        Who's Mitchell?
      </h3>
      <div class="bout">
        <p>
          Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Mitchell. I am a student at Our
          Lady of the Bay Catholic High School in Collingwood Ontario. I am
          currently taking a computer science course, and have experience with
          html, css, javascript and a little bit of python. A few of my hobbies
          include playing and building guitars, messing around with electronics,
          and messing around with personal computers. I am interested in linux,
          opensource operating systems and firmware and networking.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I plan to take a year off following the end of this school year to
          work and gain experience. I then plan to go to Conestoga College for a
          powerline technician program. The program length is two years and has
          a co op option, in which students earn on average ten thousand dollars
          per term.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p id="last">
          I have not quite made up my mind on what I will be doing for my
          tracks. I have done web development before but have I know that this
          will be a new challenge and I have never used databases. I am also
          interested in learning Swift. I do not have a mac but I know that a
          swift toolchain has been compiled for windows. I beleive I am leaning
          more towards swift since it will be an absolutly new language.

      <h3>
        Fun Facts!
      </h3>
      <div class="bout">
        <p>
          Here are a few fun facts about me. I have my own workshop, with
          showroom foam floors, stereo system and even a mini fridge. I have 9
          chickens, and my family is getting another 10. I enjoy fishing, being
          outdoors, and swimming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a total of 5 guitars, 1 electric, 4 acoustic. 1 electric bass
          guitar, 1 banjo, 1 violin, and one piano. Although it is a lot. They
          all have different properties that make them fun and different to
          play.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working on cars and gardening. My family owns a 1975 Dart
          Sport. We have it running and now will be getting on the road,
          hopefully by this summer. This year in my garden I am planting, mint,
          rosemary, basil, pumpkins, potatoes, beans, peas and much more.
